# Final Project
## [1] Idea
The project is designed to replace the manual wash log at Enterprise Rent A Car with digital equivalents. This should allow increased efficiency, decrease in field workloads, and an increase communication between different levels of employee in regards to fleet management.
## [2] Platform
The project is designed to be executed in a mobile environment, mainly Android compatible mobile devices. This will allow the program to take advantage of the sensors available to mobile devices, such as the camera and GPS information. This should allow Service Agents to concentrate on their main duties and focus less on paperwork and unit management.
## [4] Method of Operation
The program should be able to scan a standardized key tag, import the information, allow changes to imported information as per user needs, allow additions to imported information (such as notes etc.), and finally to produce a standard .CSV file that can be imported into Excel and printed out at the end of the day.
## [3] Problems
This project is designed to run on Android platforms, which represents a significant departure from the JAVA base logic that the developer has been studying. Further issues may present themselves during the Object Recognition and Optical Character Recognition implementations, both of which will harness the camera in tandem to recognize and digitize key tag information.
